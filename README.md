# LWJGL solutions "Interactive Computer Graphics" and 3D generative art

This Eclipse based project contains an LWJGL skeleton used for

  * the solutions - work in progress - of the exercises in Edward Angel's and
  Dave Shreiner's excellent book "Interactive Computer Graphics. A Top-Down
  Approach with WebGL".
  * free form 3D graphics generative art and procedural generation works based
  on or inspired by Angel's and Shreiner's book.

The sekeleton itself is based on [the chapter
8](https://lwjglgamedev.gitbooks.io/3d-game-development-with-lwjgl/content/chapter08/chapter8.html)
great tutorial book [3D Game Development with LWJGL
3](https://ahbejarano.gitbook.io/lwjglgamedev/).
